<!-- CSS Grid:

[I found an article on CSS grid](https://itnext.io/simple-web-layout-with-css-grid-ec6be5086531) that piqued my interest. We haven't gone over it in class, but after looking at MDN docs and playing around in the html and css sandbox files I set up, I decided I wanted to try it out. I copied the starter html and css from the tutorial to use as a template and began messing around with the fr values.

My aim for the front page is to have a small oval photo with a single line of text. A hover effect will suggest to the visitor that the element (a div containing both items) is clickable. On click, the oval will expand to reveal a full rectangular image, and the line of text will expand to paragraph length. -->

5/20 Commented out previous text as I decided to change the overall layout of my project. I was originally going to have one page of viewport height that would have htlm content generated by jquery/js depending on the tab clicked. I later decided that I would be better able to fulfill the assignment criteria with a single page scroll. CSS grid worked well for my original layout, but poorly for the single page scroll. This new layout will be mostly flexbox, with bootstrap aiding in the responsiveness.

Carousel and sticky header are handled by Bootstrap.

Difficulties thus far:

Aside from the constant tweaking of flexbox properties, by far the most difficult aspect of this projects has been settling on a design. At the project's start, I opted for designing my own layout, especially as I saw some great original ideas being tried out by classmates. As the project progressed, however, I found this more difficult, and ended up scrapping what I had and moving towards a design closer to the mockup provided.

As my portfolio and web development skillset grows, I will have content to put on this site, and add features and functionality.

Needs finishing:

-Hamburger nav
-Lightbox
-JQuery scroll
