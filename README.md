CSS Grid:

[I found an article on CSS grid](https://itnext.io/simple-web-layout-with-css-grid-ec6be5086531) that piqued my interest. We haven't gone over it in class, but after looking at MDN docs and playing around in the html and css sandbox files I set up, I decided I wanted to try it out. I copied the starter html and css from the tutorial to use as a template and began messing around with the fr values.

My aim for the front page is to have a small oval photo with a single line of text. A hover effect will suggest to the visitor that the element (a div containing both items) is clickable. On click, the oval will expand to reveal a full rectangular image, and the line of text will expand to paragraph length.
